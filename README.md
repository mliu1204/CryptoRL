### Reinforcement Learning in Cryptocurrency Trading

This repository presents a combined supervised learning and reinforcement learning framework for automated trading of small-cap cryptocurrencies. These assets are characterized by extreme short-term volatility and short lifespans, posing unique challenges for end-to-end RL systems. By training three seperate LSTM price predictors and feeding their predictions as features for PPO-based trading agent, we were able to improve stability and profitability of our model.
